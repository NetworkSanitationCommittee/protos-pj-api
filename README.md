If you want to try generating stuff locally, you'll need to do some go installs:

```
go install github.com/bufbuild/buf/cmd/buf@latest
go install github.com/fullstorydev/grpcurl/cmd/grpcurl@latest
go install google.golang.org/protobuf/cmd/protoc-gen-go@latest
go install github.com/bufbuild/connect-go/cmd/protoc-gen-connect-go@latest
```
